\title{Plot Length-Weight Model Diagnostics}
\usage{
plot_lw_diagnostics(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model object returned by fit_lw()}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot2 objects:
\item{residuals_vs_fitted}{Residuals vs fitted values plot}
\item{qq_plot}{Normal Q-Q plot of residuals}
\item{scale_location}{Scale-Location plot (sqrt of standardized residuals vs fitted)}
\item{residuals_vs_length}{Residuals vs length plot}
}
\description{
This function creates diagnostic plots for length-weight relationship fits,
including residual plots, Q-Q plots, and other diagnostics to assess model
fit quality.
}
\details{
The diagnostic plots help assess:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Residuals vs Fitted}: Should show random scatter around zero.
Patterns indicate potential model misspecification.
\item \strong{Q-Q Plot}: Points should follow the diagonal line if residuals
are normally distributed.
\item \strong{Scale-Location}: Should show roughly constant spread.
A funnel shape indicates heteroscedasticity.
\item \strong{Residuals vs Length}: Should show random scatter.
Patterns may indicate that the power relationship is inadequate.
}

# Simulate length-weight data
set.seed(123)
length <- runif(100, 10, 50)
weight <- 0.01 * length^3 * exp(rnorm(100, 0, 0.1))

# Fit the model
fit <- fit_lw(length = length, weight = weight)
