Create a small functional R package that estrimates von Bertalanffy Growwtrh curves from age anbd lenght data.
1. Use the function s in InitialCode/(03) Fit vonB nls (TOA).r and InitialCode/(03) Fit vonB nls (TOA).r to
1a. Fit a von bertanalnnfy function using nls
1b. optionally fit a bayesian von bertalanffy function using brms
2. Take a vector of ages and a equal length vectort of lenfgths to fit the curves
3. Fit the curves where the CV is a function of mean length
4. have functions sumarise the reswults zand report estimates, 95% intervals of the parametes
5. have functions to plot the curves and the undsrlying data inclung;
5a. summaries oif the number of observations by year
5b. heat map or symbol plot of the age length obseervations 
6. Plot standard regression diagnostics for the fits
7. plot posteriorr predictive plolts for the bayesian estimates
8. add an R citiation file
9. Ensure all R files have adequate roxygen headers
10. Also refernce key scientific papers in a fully documented readme markdown file, uise british english, and include the following refernce:
@techreport{WGFSA2025-34,
  abstract    = {This report characterises the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) fishery in CCAMLR Subarea 48.6 through the 2024/25 season, summarising catch and effort data, biological sampling, tagging results, age composition, and progress toward stock assessment. Since its inception in 1997, the fishery has evolved into a structured research program with four designated research blocks (486_2â€“486_5). In 2024, total catches included 460 tonnes of D. mawsoni, with possible recruitment suggested by presence of small (<110 cm) and large (>180 cm) fish.},
  address     = {Hobart},
  author      = {Okuda, T. and Somhlaba, S. and Sarralde, R. and Mori, M. and Rojo, V. and Dunn, A.},
  institution = {CCAMLR},
  number      = {WG-FSA-2025/34},
  title       = {Characterisation of the toothfish fishery in Subarea 48.6 through the 2024/25 season},
  type        = {Working Group Paper},
  url         = {file:///C:/Users/alist/OneDrive/Projects/2026/WG-FSA-2025/WG%20Papers/WG-FSA-2025-34.pdf},
  year        = {2025}
}
11. Add a methods markdown file that would be suiotable for inclusion in a report that uses this package. Use british english throughout
12. Add a tempolate 'results' markdown file as a template for users to report the results.
13. Add unit tests to validate the package is working
