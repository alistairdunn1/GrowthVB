\title{Plot Empirical Coefficient of Variation by Age}
\usage{
plot_empirical_cv(age, length, sex = NULL, min_n = 3, add_smoother = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{A numeric vector of ages}

\item{length}{A numeric vector of lengths}

\item{sex}{An optional factor or character vector specifying the sex for each observation}

\item{min_n}{Minimum number of observations required per age group to calculate CV (default 3)}

\item{add_smoother}{Logical, whether to add a smoother line showing the CV trend (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
This function creates a plot showing the empirical coefficient of variation (CV)
of length measurements by age. This is useful for understanding how variability
in length changes with age and for validating CV models in von Bertalanffy fits.
The smoother ribbon matches the line color with reduced transparency.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simple example with simulated data
age <- rep(1:15, each = 10)
length <- 100 * (1 - exp(-0.2 * (age - (-0.5)))) +
  rnorm(length(age), 0, 5 + 0.1 * age) # CV increases with age
plot_empirical_cv(age = age, length = length)
}
