Description: Estimates von Bertalanffy Growth curves from age and length data. 
    Provides both maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with heteroscedastic errors 
    and Bayesian (brms) approaches to fitting, visualization tools for diagnostics, 
    and methods for summarising parameter estimates. The MLE approach explicitly 
    models the coefficient of variation as a function of length, which is more 
    appropriate for biological growth data.
